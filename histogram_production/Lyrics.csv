Rolling Stones,Satisfaction,"I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no
When I'm drivin' in my car, and the man come on the radio
He's tellin' me more and more about some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no
When I'm watchin' my tv and a man comes on and tell me
How white my shirts can be
But, he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get girl reaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no
When I'm ridin' round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl, who tells me
Baby, better come back maybe next week
Can't you see I'm on a losing streak
I can't get no, oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey
That's what I say, I can't get no, I can't get no
I can't get no satisfaction, no satisfaction
No satisfaction, no satisfaction",Rock
Kelly Clarkson,Because of You,"I will not make
The same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break
The way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known
Better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life
Because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you
Because of you",Pop
Paula Cole,Where Have All the Cowboys Gone,"Oh you get me ready in your 56 Chevy 
Why don't we go sit down in the shade 
Take shelter on my front porch 
The dandy lion sun scorching
Like a glass of cold lemonade 
I will do the laundry 
If you pay all the bills
Where is my John Wayne 
Where is my prairie song 
Where is my happy ending 
Where have all the cowboys gone
Why don't you stay the evening 
Kick back and watch the TV 
And I'll fix a little something to eat 
Oh I know your back hurts from working on the tractor 
How do you take your coffee my sweet 
I will raise the children 
If you pay all the bills
Where is my John Wayne 
Where is my prairie song 
Where is my happy ending 
Where have all the cowboys gone
I am wearing my new dress tonight 
But you don't, but you don't even notice me
Say goodbyes 
Say goodbyes 
Say goodbyes
We finally sell the Chevy 
When we had another baby 
And you took the job in Tennessee 
You made friends at the farm 
And you joined them at the bar 
Almost every single day of the week
I will wash the dishes 
While you go have a beer 
Where is my John Wayne 
Where is my prairie song 
Where is my happy ending 
Where have all the cowboys gone
Where is my Marlboro man 
Where is his shiny gun 
Where is my lonely ranger 
Where have all the cowboys gone

The Black Dahlia Murder,Widowmaker,"You're locked in my sights
And it'd be my delight
To blow your head clean off the neck where it rests
As you'll see that I do specialize
In a one-shot surprise a sniper they've called me the best
You'd suggest I'm a cold hearted man
Well it's a cold hearted world
And besides if you'd open your eyes there's always been demand to be met
Need someone destroyed? I'm gainfully employed
No mark is too sordid no victim too close
I am death
I profess I've a cold hearted plan to ingress from this cold hearted life
While the competition rests I am obsessed
Exacting success one mark at a time
Killing is my business and at my business I excel
By silenced gun or silver blade it's the shock on their face as I send them
Screaming to hell
Succinctly my conscience is clean
Though truly this work is a mess
To silence I've sworn this heart doth not mourn
Emotionless to no god I'll confess

Largely but a ghost to them, most won't see me at all
A red dot centered patiently where the spine does meet the skull and they're gone
Killing is my business and at my business I excel
By silenced gun or silver blade it's the shock on their face as I send them to hell
Crimes of lust a sworn revenge reclaiming what's been lost
Adulterers extortionists all pains I'm paid to stop
They call me the widowmaker",Metal
Frank Carter & the Rattlesnakes,Wild Flowers,"She is so beautiful
With flowers in her hair
Her perfume smells like summer air
And her lips are the sweetest like honey and milk
And her skin white like cocaine but soft as silk
And her hair is as black as a reservoir

At midnight and still and it takes me so far
So far that I don't believe that there is an end
But if there is I will climb and dive in again

We picked daisies and I made a chain
Asleep in the grass, both feeling insane
And if this isn't love don't show me the truth
I said if this isn't love
I'm gonna need some

Tiny wild flowers all tied in your hair
Like stars in the sky just floating there
A constellation gorgeous and new
You called it The Lovers
I believed it was true

And all of a sudden you rose from our nest
No longer felt love
I felt sorrow instead
As you walked you combed out your hair
And all the flowers fell like birds through the air

We picked daisies and I made a chain
Asleep in the grass, both feeling insane
And if this isn't love don't show me the truth
I said if this isn't love
I'm gonna need some

Like stars in the sky
Falling to earth
The Lovers are dead
The Lovers are cursed

Asleep in the grass, both feeling insane
And if this isn't love don't show me the truth

William Elliot Whitmore,There is Hope For You,"My little sparrow there is hope for you.
Your life has just begun.
And I could not do what I wanted to.
And I fear my time is almost done.

But through your actions truth will carry on.
Go forth with joy in your heart.
And even though I will be gone.
You've got to play your part.

Listen to me now.
You will overcome I promise you.
And be whatever it is that you want to be.
There is hope for you oh there's hope for you.
But its much to late for me.

The wayward weeping voices that you will hear.
Each with their own story to tell.
And you have the choice to bend your ear.
And treat your fellow humans well.

So goodbye my little sparrow.
Its time that I must go.
To keep on the straight and narrow.
Well there's something you must know.

Listen to me now.
You will overcome I promise you.
And be whatever it is that you want to be.
There is hope for you, oh there's hope for you.
But its much to late for me.

You will overcome I promise you.
And be whatever it is that you want to be.
There is hope for you, oh there's hope for you.

David Bowie,The Man Who Sold the World,"We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago
Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
At all the millions here
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control

You turned around and walked away with me",Pop
